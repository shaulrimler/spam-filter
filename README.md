# Spam Filter using Naive Bayes Algorithm
This project was created using a text dataset put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, and it can be downloaded from the [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).<br>
Support for this project comes courtesy of Dataquest. I have added dditional explorations and real-life applications.
